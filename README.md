This is a python project compatible with Windows. It includes a .exe file (in the dist file) that can be sent to others. It is a simple guessing game that can either be won or, after three failed attempts, will shut down the computer. Note that the displayed text before shutdown is made to look like malware, but the text is display-only (it is harmless).

Note that in the fun_aux file, the name variable can be changed so the program does not refer to the user as just "Friend".  Note that if this program is sent to someone and this change is made in the source code, one will need to re-bundle it with pyinstaller or something else.
